This is a simple example to demonstrate the ability of the Socket
module to do more than just running a client and a server on 2 threads
in the same process and communicating on localhost.
* sender.ml reads lines from stdin and pushes them to the channel with id 1
* server.ml is, well, the server...
* reciever.ml gets the input from channel 1 and prints it
Result: type in one terminal, get back what you wrote in another!
